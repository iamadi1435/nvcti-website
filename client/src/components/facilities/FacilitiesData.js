Hence a prototype battery fabrication unit in the form of coin or Pouch cell will help the students to have hand-on experience on the techniques used for battery fabrication and their testing which enable them to test their materials for efficiency. This Unit will help for in-house production of battery prototype, which could be scale-up for further development based on their capacity and integration with solar cells.",
